# Sensor & Peripheral UI Modules

This repository contains UI implementations for various sensors and peripherals. Each module provides a consistent user interface layer to visualize sensor states, readings, and interactions using indicators such as LEDs, buzzers, and button inputs.

# Included UI Modules

BME680_UI – Environmental data display (temperature, humidity, pressure)

STTS751_UI – Temperature monitoring interface

STS30_UI / SHT40_UI – Temperature and humidity UI

Weather_Shield_UI – Consolidated weather sensor UI

UV_LTR390_UI – Ambient light and UV indication interface

VCNL_LuxSensor_UI – Proximity and ambient light UI

LIS3DH_UI – Motion and orientation indication UI

TOF_VL53L0X_UI – Distance measurement UI

Hall_Effect_UI – Magnetic detection UI

Relay_UI – Relay status and control UI

LED_Blink_UI – LED patterns and visual indicators

Buzzer_UI – Audio alert and notification UI

# About the UI
